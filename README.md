## Overview
Currency Hedging is a collection of scripts written in Python, R, and Java that implement a currency hedging strategy. The scripts provide functionality to calculate the settlement amount and hedged amount for a given amount to be hedged, exchange rates, transaction costs, risk tolerance, and various risk management strategies.

## Description
This project offers currency hedging solutions in three different programming languages: Python, R, and Java. Each script provides the same functionality to calculate the settlement amount and hedged amount based on the provided inputs and risk management strategies.

- `currency-hedge.py`: Python script that implements the currency hedging strategy.
- `currency-hedge.R`: R script that implements the currency hedging strategy.
- `currency-hedge.java`: Java class that implements the currency hedging strategy.

## Features
- Calculate settlement amount and hedged amount based on input parameters.
- Support for transaction costs in the target currency.
- Various risk management strategies:
  - Stop loss: Set a threshold exchange rate to limit losses.
  - Take profit: Set a threshold exchange rate to secure profits.
  - Trailing stop loss: Set a distance from the highest exchange rate to trail stop loss.
  - Partial hedging: Hedge only a percentage of the total amount.
  - Diversification: Allocate a proportion of the remaining hedged amount for diversification.
  - Rebalancing: Rebalance the position size based on a specified percentage.
  - Correlation threshold: Adjust position size based on correlation.
  - Volatility stop loss: Set a stop loss based on volatility.
  - Profit target: Set a target exchange rate for taking profits.
  - Max drawdown: Limit losses based on the maximum allowed drawdown.
  - Cost averaging: Average the position size over time.
  - Dynamic position sizing: Adjust the position size dynamically based on a multiplier.
  - Option cost: Deduct the cost of options used for hedging.
  - Stress testing: Test the position size under stressed market conditions.
  - Scenario analysis: Adjust the position size based on scenario analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the currency hedging scripts, follow the installation instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Python: Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).
- R: Make sure you have R installed (version 3.0 or later).
- Java: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-hedging.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
- Python: Install the `forex-python` library using `pip`:

  ```
  pip install forex-python
  ```

## Usage
1. Python:
- Open the `currency-hedge.py` file in a Python IDE or text editor.
- Modify the input parameters and risk management strategies as needed.
- Run the script to see the calculated settlement amount and hedged amount.

2. R:
- Open the `currency-hedge.R` file in an R IDE or text editor.
- Modify the input parameters and risk management strategies as needed.
- Run the script to see the calculated settlement amount and hedged amount.

3. Java:
- Open the `currency-hedge.java` file in a Java IDE or text editor.
- Modify the input parameters and risk management strategies as needed.
- Compile and run the Java program to see the calculated settlement amount and hedged amount.

## Configuration
No specific configuration is required for the currency hedging scripts. However, you may need to modify the scripts to customize certain parameters or risk management strategies according to your specific needs.

## Dependencies
- Python: The `forex-python` library is required. Install it using `pip install forex-python`.
- R: No additional dependencies are required.
- Java: No additional dependencies are required.
